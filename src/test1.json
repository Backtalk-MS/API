For example, if the first piece of text you assign the Title style becomes the title of the sway (if you don't assign anything as Title, the filename becomes the title of the sway). But  unlike Word, a Sway's title offers you a \"title image\".Question 1: How would you configure your docx so that Sway puts the correct image in its title card?I've also found by trial and error that Heading 1 and Strong styles correspond to Sway's Heading card and Emphasize text, but haven't found the style that causes Sway to Accent the text.Question 2: How would you configure your docx so that Sway  accents specific text on your card?The grouping feature in Sway is cool. I'm using it to group text and an image so both appear on the same page. Question 3: How would you configure your docx so that Sway groups (GROUP TYPE: Automatic) a chunk of text and a gif together?  Please help point me in the right direction in general or answer these specific questions. My boss likes to review content in Word but wants me to make a presentation of the same content. I thought Sway's import might be a time-saver if I write out my Word  document prudently.",

I try to avoid items overlapping between newsletters... as topics vary a lot I may need to check an older newsletter on a topic - did I already mention this in this way, or not.

The number of results is shown in the control+F bar > fine! However both the preview results AND the storyline results are counted - they are the same.... ;) so all items are counted twice. That is not the major issue,  though.  What bothers me is that once I ask to see the first results really NOTHING happens on my screen... it is only until I move towards half way of the results that my search text is being highlighted > only from half of the results the storyline is searched  (first the preview is searched)... that is awkward, needs a lot of clicking when the word occurs often in your document... and only then one can check whether or not it was relevant / needs to be replaced etcetera.  > Is this the only way to search a Sway document? > Is it possible to start searching within the storyline (for the author / editor)  ((a regular reader only sees the preview - which should be searchable too))  so far I got about 8 hits on the words I searched for (4 real + 4 copies that is ;)) so not that an issue but that moment will come....  regards, HenrikeGC",

Use SWAY just like every other Office product meaning I install the app(or 365), tinker for a while, and create  a file. 2. A file I store, where I want to. 3. A file just like .xlsx .docx .pptx .vsdx. 4. I will never ever use this application if these three things are not met.  I own my content, period.",

Also, while I'm asking, should I be uploading my videos in MP4/H.264, compressed to achieve a smaller file-size,or is it OK to upload relatively large/uncompressed WMVs?

I'm preparing a presentation video for my consulting services. I live in the Pacific NW & think it would be very eye catching to have the video start out with a video clip. I want to find a high mountain video clip of Mt. Ranier (there are many on YouTube)  & I want to embed that \"high mountain / clouds\" video at the start point of my Sway presentation (even before any Text). So, to reiterate, a video with and/or without sound, so ideally the sound of wind, and the sight of mountain & clouds. I do know that  I can bring a full video into Sway ... I just did that, but I want to have the video edited so that I'm bring in just a portion of the video. Again, I want to control the duration, and start and end point of the video that I'm bringing into Sway. I realize  that this may be less of a Sway question then a video editing type question. But, I'm a novice and so I think this is a good place to start with obtaining a solution to my \"vision\".  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",

Like Sway, which is available on iOS and Android, as also Cortana for Android which can be downloaded via a variety of sources. I have never been able to use Cortana unless  I change my settings to US format (which will not really comply with my phone and region). SO, why? \"Siri\" can speak many languages, and for her it does not matter where you are on the planet or what your phone settings are, why is it, that Cortana need US  English, and cannot comply, with (for example; Singapore English (which is basically British English). Microsoft, why are we, your trusted users get everything last and the competition everything first?  So, the same with SWAY..... :-D  Now, because of this, I am not running out now to get me some iOS or Android devices, I am still a big fan of Microsoft and now even a bigger fan due to the fact that I LOVE the seamless working Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile combination on my devices  :-D  It is just a question, however, I would love to get an answer to that though.

        "content": "Hi,  I have a query and an experience to share.  As you must know that a FREE user can only put a maximum of 200 Items in his/her sway. Whereas if you are an Office 365 subscriber there is no such limit or maybe there is of about 1500 items, I am not sure.   But let me tell you what my concern is: Recently I had to create a presentation regarding my college project. So I found this as a perfect opportunity to try it. It took me a little while to get to know the interface and know how it works. And while I was in between creating my presentation, there came an error stating that I had reached my limit of 200 Items and to continue creating my sway  I would have to subscribe to Office 365. At first I was a little worried because the next day was the deadline for the submission of my project and this issue was wasting my valuable time. But seeing no other option I immediately went to grab my credit card  and subscribed myself to Office 365 Home. And then there I was back to creating my presentation without any worries. I was able to complete the presentation and submit it the next day. By the way it went wonderful, the teacher liked it a lot.  A few days went. One day while I was scrolling through my emails, I found one regarding the next deduction of the my monthly subscription of Office 365. Then I wondered why I was wasting my valuable money each month when I was already  over with my work. So I immediately went towards cancelling my subscription. And just when I was about to click on the cancel button, there hit me something in the mind.  \"What will happen to my existing sway once I cancel the subscription?\"  I wondered many scenarios:  Maybe the whole sway will get deletedMaybe it'll be cut in half i.e. only the first 200 Items would remain and the rest won'tMaybe nothing will happen, I will have my sway forever. While I was thinking about the consequences I remembered that I would be needing this sway in the future.  Since I was not using my Office 365 Home subscription for anything else except sway, I thought of it as a waste of money. But, before coming to any conclusion I thought to better search about this issue online and was pretty confident about finding an answer immediately   But my assumption turned out to be way more than just wrong. I couldn't find anything regarding my issue anywhere on the several support pages of Microsoft. I even went through all the FAQs. But no answer. Then I thought to contact Microsoft Support about it. First I went in chat with an Answer Tech. What that person basically told me was that there was no such thing as Sway in Office 365 Home and also that he/she was unable to find anything regarding that issue in their databases so, they were unable help me.  Also this chat between us went for about an hour or so because of their delay in replying. I don't know how many persons does one Answer Tech handle at a time.  Then I thought it would be better to have a one on one talk with a support person. So I went into another feature \"Call Me As Soon As Possible\". It showed me that I would receive a call after a minute, but no one called. I gave it another try a few hours later hoping to get a call this time. But again no one called. I then tried this again the next day, but still  no one called. And what was surprising was that, every time it showed me that I would receive a call after a certain minutes. All of this what I did was in their business hours as mentioned by them on their website. Later I went for another feature \"Schedule a Call\". And you know what, the same story happened again. which I don't wanna repeat.  Tired from not finding any solution I thought to gave up. But after getting over with the frustrations of the last experience. I thought to gave it another try. So I went looking for an alternate way to contact support. And I thought it would be the best  to myself call the Microsoft Support. So in search for a number to call, I again got in chat with an answer tech and straight away asked them for a number rather than explaining the whole issue. Since I live in India so, they gave me the support numbers for my country. What I figured out later was that all the numbers were basically the same i.e. all of them redirected towards one location. And so finally I had a chat with someone on the phone who at first seemed like qualified person. But I was disappointed as they too gave the same excuse, even they didn't had any solution to my query in their databases. Also they gave me another number,  which they said would be the best place to get the help as those people (on that number) were more qualified than them. Without thinking I dialed the number. And what that number turned out to be was of the Microsoft's American Support center. After getting connected to an American support executive, he/she refused to help me stating that I should call on the numbers for  my country, And gave me those same numbers that were given to me by that answer tech.  But, This time I was determined on finding a solution. So I called again on those Indian numbers. Again told them my trouble and again received the same response as earlier, asking me to contact on that same American number as earlier. I even told them that  I already did so. But they kept on saying they were not that qualified.  As I mentioned earlier that this time I was determined. So I called them back again on that American support number. The person on the other side this time said the SAME thing again. Now this was getting me angry. But I was determined , So I called back again on the same number hoping that this time some other person might help me. This time the support executive told me that  they only handle Office 365 Business subscribers and if I am one then only they could help me otherwise they had another solution for me. Now guess what that solution could be.........YES YOU ARE CORRECT..!! THOSE INDIAN NUMBERS AGAIN.    Now here I am at present. Days have past and what I only have with me are those numbers and my pending query which I didn't expected to be that unique. I have given all the hopes and have no other option left but to pay my hard earned money each month just to keep my presentation alive.  THE END",

Groups were sometimes below, and that's OK. Most pictures were of a discreet size -- large enough to see, but not so large as to overwhelm or even to take up the whole viewing area.  But just a few days ago, this changed and now my Sways appear as centered text (about 2/3 of the screen width) with all pictures following the text, and some of quite large, much larger than I would prefer to see.  I am fairly confident I have not made a change myself to the style -- because it has to be done in individual Sways, there being no way to store style changes -- and I have over 30 Sways in this series, and all are affected.  This change is visible in both Preview and Play mode, but not in full-screen play mode: then it reverts to what it used to be, and which I would prefer it to be.  So what gives? I am baffled. Did I do something wrong? Did the behaviour of Sway just change on us? Has some enhancement had an unnoticed side-effect?  What can I do to get it back to where it was?  Thanks",

It's pretty surprising as it's not like I'm adding images and then editing them so all the memory is being used up or anything and my PC is running an i5 processor with 16gb of ram, and the only other app that I'm running in the background in Chrome for  a little fact checking, so it's not doing much either.  I've had it on another Sway that I was building, which did have a bunch of images and I was moving them around and grouping a bit so I figured that might have something to do with it, but this one has text only and I'm not moving anything around, so I'm  surprised that this is happening.  Is there anything I can do on my side to help reduce the crashes, other than reduce the number of text boxes, because then it's back to powerpoint?  Cheers, Chris",

In other words, I am looking to create a Sway where there is a list of topics and the user can pick and choose which topic they want to explore in an order they choose.

When I was almost finished, a page went missing. That page took me 3 hours to draft.   Silly me didn't copy it to notepad which I always do - I relied on the cloud to do its job properly. I thought, it's Microsoft it's fine.  It is possible that I expanded or reduced a group of elements, but I have gone through them all and can't find anything. There's no Recycle Bin or Edit files. the page has simply disappeared.  I'm on Chrome. Everything else in the presentation is there, just the key work is missing.  Appreciate all suggestions.

The new back upworks fine as I've tried restoring files  as a test.  I've gone into the folder properties to make sure system, administrator and users have full control for the hdd, and all folders. When I open them back up, the folders have full control, but the read only button keeps coming back shaded. Not sure if this is  related since the new folder is similar.  I've taken the hdd to another laptop running Vista (SP1) and have the same issue when attempting to restore \"from another computer\".  I've looked thru the forums and didn't see anything similar, although I've seen some that come close on the web- with no solutions.  Any suggestions?

Recently, after I uninstalled ZoneAlarm Firewall and restarted to finish the process, I realized that my Vista Uninstall utility at Control Panel\\Programs\\Programs and Features was unorganized.

After running  Microsoft Office Diagnostics, the Uninstall button reappeared just for the 11 Office programs, although it didn't fix so that it was how it used to be; just the Office Suite name with the proper icon. The icons remain the same.  A number of other programs appeared as well that used to be hidden as a component of another program. In addition, the uninstall, change, and/or remove buttons don't appear. When I click on the program, it would normally appear. Now it does not. It also doesn't  appear on the right click menu (which no longer appears) and on the File button.   I also tried running System Restore however, after the restart I received a message that System Restore had failed.  When I looked at the registry key at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ CurrentVersion\\Uninstall I realized that it was blank. There were no entries located here. I had not modified this registry key in the past at all. I would like to know how to fix this issue. Thanks!",

It is not the permissions. It is allways explorer.exe locking the file. Logging off and back on solves the problem most of the time, so I can delete/rename the file from the explorer. In those cases where this does not work  I logoff/logon again, open a cmd.exe shell and delete the file there without problems.  The filetypes are .wma .wmv .mp3 .avi .jpg etc all typical media file types + a few others.  So the source of the problem is following behavior: Vista explorer.exe opens the file to read infos there, like extif info in .jpg files, like mp3-ID3-tag, etc etc. Can explorer.exe be prevented from opening those files for reading and checking information? Win XP a way to (partly) solve that was to unregister shmedia.dll, in Vista it seems to be \"wmploc.DLL\", but I would prefer a confirmation first.  This is even worse with .exe files, where Vista (and XP) allways open the file to check for the icon resource, so over slow network this leads to serious probelms.  The Questions are.. 1. How can it be prevented that Vista opens various media file types to check for their contents, and partly hang due to that (rename/delete preventing)? 2. Can it be prevented that Vista opens every .exe file to check for an icon resource, especially over VPN or ANY network connection? I do nearly all my (over VPN) filecopy stuff in a shell since I know that explorer will hang after a few seconds due to this  behavior.  KB956592 is already installed, it helps a bit, but really only a bit since it is not the folder browsing that makes it hang, it is the file-open action (especially with .exe).  Before you ask: I already did change one of the biggest vista annoyances (this .reg file should explain if by itself easier than doing it in words) so it does not check media file contents anyway due to \"automatic folder type detection\", but it still does open  those files when accidently hovering over such file, and therefore hangs on some files or make the undeletable and unrenameable.  That stuff is confirmed by the vista resource monitor and those godly sysinternals (now wininternals) tools, I see that explorer.exe is the culprit.  Don't worry, I still prefer Vista over XP : ), it is just that it needs (like XP and EVERY other OS too, no Linux exception here!) some adjustment for usability.

She sent several \"invitations\" and the password, which I tried to input and connect. Each time, she received a \"Waiting for Connection\" window and I had a \"Waiting for Connection  Window\" but nothing happened on her screen at all and I received an red & white x-(error) box advising that the connection could not be made. Is it due to the variation in the operating systems? Any ideas or advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  SSG978  ssg978",

        "content": "I have Vista Ultimate X64. My biggest problem is getting daily system restore points. I found where they were being created intask scheduler afer noticing I did not have very many restore points like i did in XP. I noticed that the restore points at login were working ok but thescheduled task was not working regularly. I was shutting down my machine daily and it wouldthen wait for the next chance but failed often based on the history tab in task scheduler.  SoI disabled the taskthat ran at login,Ithoughtit should only create one at night, and changed the scheduled restore point to run at 1:30am and turned on \"wake computer to run\". I then started shutting down by clicking the low power state button option  under the start button.  It started working fine and i was getting one every night and they were building up. (The only way I found to see restore points is to actually start the restore process, isn't there a better way? ) I have 3 volumes and only the c: volume was turned on.  I decided to turn on the other 2 volumes. It wiped out all restore points I had. I guess I can see that.  But then after that it would act sporadically. Task scheduler was telling me it ran successfully every night via the history tab, yet certain nights were not available in the restore process. And I'm not talking about the oldest ones, i'm talking about the  second newest restore point in one case. It was all over the board. Then i noticed it would not go above 12 restore points, which is ok but i used VSSADMIN list ShadowStorage at the command line as administrator and, for example, my C: volume was building  in size every night but restore points were dropping off. I was not even close to the MAX amount of disc for shadow storage.   THEN, this morning i discovered that system restore ran ok at 1:30:00am as usual and got \"task completed\" and \"action completed\" both at 1:30:07am:, but then9 minutes later at 1:39:34 there is another entry:Task Engine received message to start task. event  319(Same entry it has at 1:30:00 every night) then the next entry in history is event 101, Task Start Failed. And that is the last entry to this point in time. I have no idea what sent it a message to start at 1:39:34 after it had just finished successfully.  The result or error code it got when it errored at \"Task Start Failed\" was2147750689.   After seeing this (I've been monitoring both SystemRestore and defrag after changing them to run in the a.m. by \"waking the computer\") i went to system properties, system protection and it showed for all 3 volumes the last restore point was the one from  yesterday 1/18 at 1:30:00, even though technically it finished just fine on 1/19 but triggered again for some strange reason. I then went to sysetm restore, choose restore point, clicked next (like i always do to see all restore points) and there was only  TWO restore points available. The two most current for 1/18 and 1/17. That was it. The \"see more than 5\" check box was not there. They were the ONLY TWO.  And right now the task is sitting at \"Ready\" for status but the \"Last run result is \"The task is currently running (0x41301). Strange indeed considering the status is \"Ready\".  And also because the last entry as noted was failed with event code code above. does that make any sense?   THEN, I used VSSADMIN list shadowstorage and it is showing more growth since YESTERDAY on all 3 volumes??? The C: volume has about 15GB of USED disc space showing there, with a MAX of 20GB. How could i be losing restore points like this?Yet the disc  showing that the space is used and keeps climbing every night? These are just the most recent and bizarre occurances. I've had it reduce to 3 restore points one other time earlier on after I had started it running nightly by \"waking the computer\" when there had been 6 or 7. What is happening to my restore points and  why is the task scheduler acting freaky? Same with Defrag. Yesterday i manually defragged the machine cause it had failed the time before. It kicked off at 2:45am and when it's successful it only takes around 45 minutest at most to run. I'm not deleting and adding new files all of the time.  My usage is very consistent. last night it kicked off but as it does sometimes, never finished in the time between 2:45am and the time I logged on. Usually i don't logon again until the next evening, then there are entries for the time i logged in, in the  task scheduler history entries. I refresh them every time i look at them too. Well since i manually defragged last night, and i changed the manual task from defrag.exe -c to defrag.exe -c -w so it would defrag every fragment. Otherwise the default is  only fragments smaller than 64 MB. Maybe that is what I should always do? HELP on that one please.  But considering it was just run, this morning task scheduler showed it kicked off and action started just fine at 2:45am but had not finished. Huh? I just totally defraged all volumes last night and didn't use the machine after that. (the -c switch is to  defrag all volumes by the way, so the setting for manual defrag was to do all volumes with default defragging before i added the -w in to totally defrag all volumes. I changed it back. ) But anyway, when I logged onto the machine this morning the defrag  finished. I hace a feeling something happened after the task woke the machine and it started at 2:45. I don't know what, but it was stalled until I logged on cause it's set to finish at the next available time like most all tasks.It was set to finish only  when the machine was idle but uncheckec that cause it was never finishing in the past. It would error out instead before it ever finished, at least most of the time.It is set to try for like 3 days or run that long before it's stopped, but i think the day  to day runs were bumping into each other cause it never finished, at least not timely and that somehow was killing it.  Anyway, I don't know why it won't finish when the drives were completely defragged. It does work the way i have it setup for waking the machine at 2:45 and has successfully finished in under an hour. (I had to defrag all volumes manually back when i set  it up for this nightly run so it was caught up and could finish. I let it run weekly but set it for 4 out of the 7 days so ti should finish easily but does only sometimes. Others it does when i logon the next time or it still fails sometimes. These tasks  are so fragile and messed up. Sorry for being so very very wordy on this. I tried to explain and i'm sure i repeated myself.   The systemrestore points disappearing are what is troubling me the most. I relied on that a lot on my XP machine and it worked flawlessly. I'm thinking i should not have all volumes turned on. My D: drive is the second internal drive and right now i only  store downloads and installation files on it, so if I ever have to wipe Vista and reload it, most of my software is on that drive to start the process of resinstalling my software. The F: volume is a large 500GB external (it only has 100GB used on it and  it's restore file is very small) and it has my photos and music and stuff like that. I don't think i need to have restore points on those drives. Any advice? You see, sometimes I'll install a program but make the F: drive the data drive for the program.  Still not sure i need restore points on it. Someday i might start installing programs on the d: drive when i run out of space on c:, but until then.........what do you think? XP used to take away files that weren't there at teh restore point, and I lliked  that in som cases and likewise it would bring back files that were deleted before i ran the restore. Now files are untouched I believe....those that aren't system files I mean of course.   Please help me. I have my sleep set for 2 hours, so after the machine is woken to run these jobs, it has 2 hours before the machine goes to sleep again and i'm not sure it does if they are running. I believe it would since it goes by user input?? But 2  hours is plenty of time for these to finish. Esp. the restore points. thanks SO much, Jerry",

My question: Should I install Netframes 2 SP1?, 3.0?  2. Does sfc/scannow work (correctly/properly) in Vista Home Premium or not?  Thanks in advance for assistance.  Rob7937",

Vista has Sound Recorder, which seems to be the new Recorder which was standard under XP, However, XP recorder allowed you to edit the sound file while you were recording it. You were able to delete before or after a point, use a counter to move to a particular point, etc. Vista sound recorder does not seem to be able to edit the sound file before saving, and, in fact, only seems to give you the choice of saving or resuming recording. This seems to be because Vista Recorder creates a compressed file, XP Recorder creates a WAV file. Is there any way to edit these files, either through Recorder or some software installed on Vista or elsewhere. It is strange that the Vista version of recorder would seem to be less capable than the XP version, unless I am missing something, and the Vista version has some hidden ability to edit wav files and not go directly to a compressed format I tried to bring over the sndrec32.exe from XP to Vista into my home directory and clicking  on it, however, when I click on the sndrec32 icon I get a message \"There was an error updating the registry\", which, unfortunately, is so generic there is no further information trying to trace what it means.

WLOC (Windows Live OneCare) link setup was used to establish the link and connection to the network drive and folder for the backup path. Everything functions fine for about five days then the security firewall blocks the connection. The drive link appears in My Network Places. I click on it and get Access Denied etc. I established that it is Windows security blocking access by turning OFF the WLOC security system; clicking on the network places link and get immediate access; run the backup. It worked. Then I turned the WLOC firewall back on. For the next four days it works with the WLOC firewall on. Then we repeat the process. I've found I can turn the WLOC firewall back on as soon as I have reestablished the link; without waiting for the backup to start.  My only security is Windows built in and WLOC. My OS is XP Home but Vista is the only forum, so here I am. Computers, LAN and the network drive are all on UPS so power fluxations and interruptions are a non-problem. This situation occursfor each of thethree computerson different days, virtually eliminating the LAN or Drive as the problem. I have no idea how to start on the fix to this problem. Suggestiona?

It currently runs on a remote server, and I have been testing it online. (I am a tester who also does HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I have done a little bit of programming in the past.) Recently, we tried putting the app on my laptop computer.  My laptop is running Vista Home Premium 32-bit. I have 2005 Visual Studio and SQL Server. I have the .Net Framework turned on.  The problem is that, when I try to run the app on my computer, I am getting an error about the ASP.Net Session State. Part of the erroris listed below at the end of this message. My manager had me look in my Control Panel/Admin/Services to turn on ASP.Net  Session Service. But, it was not listed on the Services list. This may be a rather simple question, but: Why don't I have this Service? Does it have something to do with running 32-bit? (This is the main reason for me posting this.I would like to find out what is going on here. I like to learn about what is going on and why I don't have this service.)  My manager had me comment out a smallsection of code in the Web Config file of the web app that referred to the State Service, and I am now able to run the app.  I would appreciate any help. I have checked the MSDN site and others, but because I don't have much programming experience, there is a lot that I don't understand there. I would liketo know why I don't have this service.  Here is the first part of my error message I get when I try to run/debug on my laptop: Unable to make the session state request to the session state server. Please ensure that the ASP.NET State service is started and that the client and server ports are the same. If the server is on a remote machine, please  ensure that it accepts remote requests by checking the value of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\aspnet_state\\Parameters\\AllowRemoteConnection. If the server is on the local machine, and if the before mentioned registry value does not  exist or is set to 0, then the state server connection string must use either 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' as the server name.",

For example, I have a couple of internet shortcuts on my desktop as well as a couple of  text documents, and I noticed that when I go to notepad to open those text files, by selecting file-open from the menu, the open file dialog contains those internet shortcuts, even though the filter for the dialog says \"Text Documents *.txt\". I understand  that these files are text files themselves, but why would the dialog not filter them out like it does other files?  I tried this same scenario in other windows applications, too, like Windows Media Player and I saw the same thing. Turning on classic menus and choosing file-open and choosing 'Desktop' it shows no media files, but shows those two internet shortcuts, even  though none of the filters for that dialog have .url in them.",

Here's my configuration:  I connect to an Exchange server via VPN (RAS). I use a local PST as the default store. In addition to my Exchange account, I also have another \"additional mailbox\" open (it's a shared mailbox on the Exchange server). I have a very fast connection - about 15-20 MBps I'm running Windows XP SP3. I know - it's a complex configuration, but most of the time, Outlook is very fast - so I know it can and does work well.   What I can't figure out is that sometimes, a problem occurs in which Outlook hangs, or just takes a long time to respond when I click any message or folder. It's like someone throws a switch that causes a very different performance behavior. Its as though  Outlook forgets my credentials and needs to keep checking with the Exchange server for every action.   When the problem happens, if I click Cancel Server Request, Outlook is fine for about 10 seconds, and then it slows down again. If I click Work Offline on the File menu in Outlook, Outlook runs fine. If I try to run Outlook in Online mode again, it starts  hanging again. This problem occurs if I am Rasd in or if Im working offline using RDP over Http.   Other times, most of the time, Outlook is fine its very fast. It runs great, and then bam for no apparent reason, it starts hanging again. When the problem happens, it can last a day or two or only just a few hours. Its a major pain though.   Heres what Ive tried none of these have resolved the problem: Change the VPN Disable all add-ons Run Outlook /safe Run Outlook /cleanrules Run outlook /cleanprofile Delete everything here: C:\\Documents and Settings\\v-dgit\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Outlook Built a new profile Run PST repair tool on the PST Detect and Repair on Office Uninstall/Re-install Office  Nothing resolves the problem. The problem is there, and then suddenly, for no apparent reason, Outlook starts working properly again. Then a day later, it happens again.   The only thing that seems to affect the problem (when it happens) is to click Cancel Server Request, or click Work Offline on the File menu in Outlook.  This suggests that its directly related to Outlook trying to communicate something to or from the Exchange server.  Could it be an issue with my corp user account being corrupted? Maybe Outlook is trying to verify my credentials?  Why would this problem stop and then start again for no apparent reason? Im considering flattening the box, but that seems extreme for an issue that seems suspiciously as though it is server related.   Any ideas you may have would sure be appreciated!!!  Darryl Gittins",

After installing this program, my computer does not go through the entire  startup procedure - it skips right past the account selection (not allowing me to choose the correct user) and does not display the desktop (although desktop files are still accessible through folders). The first screen that appears has an empty startup bar  and the background and nothing else appears on the screen. I have attempted to uninstall the program, but this does not correct the error. I am unable to use system restore because all my restore points are more recent than the software installation. How  can I correct my windows startup?",

I've just purchased a new Dell computer with Windows Vista on it, I have also purchased and installed Office 2007 with Outlook 2007. I want to have multiple email accounts, so that everytime we open Outlook 2007 it asks us which account we want to sign in  as. As I searched and how to do this with Vista, it said to go to control panel, user accounts and like the 'mail' button to add multiple email accounts. It also noted (all this in the Vista help) said that I had to have outlook installed and used it at  least once to have the 'mail' option. Well, I have Outlook 2007 installed, and have run it multiple times, and yet I never have the 'mail' option when I go to user accounts. The only option I have is to set up seperate user accounts for Windows, which I  don't want to do, I just want different user accounts for Outlook 2007. I know it's a Vista issue, because I have Outlook 2007 running on my older laptop with Windows XP and I have multiple accounts no problem. So my biggest issue is why doesn't Vista recognize  that I have Outlook 2007 on my computer, and that I have run it multiple times, to give me the option of adding mutlitple email accounts under control panel, user accounts? I've tried it with Outlook opened, with it closed, rebooted the computer mulitple  times, even gave up last night, shut down the computer turned it on this morning and I still don't have that option. Vista as installed all the updates available (it did that for about 2 hours last night) and I have Windows Vista Home Premium, Service Pack  1.  Any help you could recommend would be greatly apprecited. Thanks.  Paul",

Shockwave Flash Player is already installed, but it acts as if it isn't. If I re-install it it makes no difference.  Anyway, long story short, I came across your info (below) as I wanted to try the inbuilt admin account to see if I got the same problem.   When I tried method 1, I didn't have \"Local Users and Groups\" in the \"Computer Management Console\".  When I try Method 2, I just get permission denied. When I right click the \"run\" icon I do not get a \"Run as administrator\" option (because I am using an admin account I guess).   I have also tried \"subinacl\" and it says that SeSecurityPrivilege is not set. The actual message is below:   C:\\Program Files\\Windows Resource Kits\\Tools>subinacl /samobject *users* /display  SeSecurityPrivilege : Access is denied. WARNING :Unable to set SeSecurityPrivilege privilege. This privilege may be required.   Is there any way I can check my privileges (i.e. is there a cmd tool that will allow me to see \"Local Users and Groups\").  Any other ideas would be most welcome. Regards Richard How to activate the Administrator Account Method 1: Through User Account Control 1. Go to your Start menu and right-click on the My Computer icon. 2. Choosing Manage from the list will prompt a User Account Control (UAC). 3. When you are done, the Computer Management console will appear. Expand the Local Users and Groups option with the use of the arrow next to it and choose Users folder.  4. You can now select the Administrator Account and go to the Actions panel to open More Actions.  5. Choose Properties to open the Administrator Properties dialog box and uncheck the option labeled Account is Disabled.  6. When done, click OK to confirm changes. 7. The Administrator account should now be present on your log in screen. Method 2: With Command Prompt 1. Go to your Start menu and in Accessories list, open Command Prompt by right-clicking on its icon and choosing Run as Administrator  2. When the Command Prompt window appears, enter the command net user administrator /active:yes  3. When done, log out from your current account. 4. The Administrator account should now be present on your log in screen.",

I really like the program and wish to continue using it.  I recently bought a new computer (Dell XPS in December 08) with Vista x64 premium. I have had various issues with MSN mail, since using Vista, that I did not have with XP. The rest of the premium package such as MSN explorer has worked very well on Vista.  What are the known issues and work arounds with MSNmail and Vista x64?  I have found very little information on it. I have read various forum posts, but most don't offer any real helpful solutions. MSN mail support seems to be lacking. Calling Qwest gets me a technician who recommends I switch to Windows Live mail. Qwest seems  to think MSN mail is not compatible with Vista, but one of the postsI read from a Microsoft Engineer assures everyone that Vista is compatible with MSN mail and works fine.  Here are some of my issues: 1. MSN mail reacting very slow when I select an action, such as opening an email or deleting it. It was extremely fast for a while after I first installed it, but more and more it is getting sluggish and slow.  2. More and more I am getting \"MSN has stopped working and needs to be shut down.\" Which is very irritating when it shows up right after I hit send after typing a long email response.  3. Currently if I try to use photo sharing email it shuts the MSN program down.  4. In the MSN mail program, I have it set upfor 4 different email accounts.They are all MSN or hotmail accounts that I have been using for years. When I am having problems with one of them (such as the connection to the server is lost, yellow icon) I select  one ofthe other accounts and they are fine. I also use IE to go to the email site directly and that works fine.I have fixed thismore than once by removing the account from MSN mail, restarting the MSN program and adding the account back in again. That  is a real pain to have to do over and over. 5. IsMSN premium going to continue using MSN mail or switch to Live mail? As far as I can tell Live mail has all the support and MSN has next to none.  Needless to say this is very frusterating. I am contemplating removing Vista from my system and installing XP premium, I did not have any of these problems when I was using that operating system.  Does anyone out thereknow any of these answers? Can you point me to a knowledge base or website, etc that has information on these issues? Is there an MSN knowledgable contact you might refer me to?  I believe this is more of a Vista problem than an MSN problem (since I didn't have these problems with XP), which is why I may end up removing Vista from my machine.  I will appreciate any helpful replies. Thanks, Frank Fleming",

Part of the setup was to move the message cache to a common shared folder called C:\\outlook.  Unfortunately, my profile on the desktop crashed. I followed the directions for creating a new account and transferred most of my files, but it didn't set up the mail account. I had to do it manually. But I can't seem to import my old mail messages. I know  they are still in the folder, but the mail account on the new profile won't access them. I've tried the import wizard. It doesn't recognize the files as e-mail.

        "content": "I just bought a new HP Pavillion Desktop (AMD quad core processor, 8G Mem, 512M graphics card, 750 MB HDD running Vista 64) and am having a problem with all applications that have a link to open and send an email. Here's a little history that I think  may have something to do with my problem:  1) I bought the unit with MS Works bundle but a week later bought the MS Office 2--7 Small Business Bundle (on sale at Best Buy). The documentation stated that I could upgrade directly from Works after I first downloaded the 9.0 Works upgrade(which I did)  Unfortunately the upgrade still wouldn't recognize Works and kept asking for the Works install disk (which does not come with the HP as everything was already installed on the hard drive.   2) I then called MS, got avery knowledgeable technician, and after trying several things he said it would be easier if he just sent me a link where I could download the entire office suite and activate with the product key provided on the Office Small Business  2007 case.  3) I downloaded it to the desktop and installed it, taking all recommeded defaults,and made it my default email. Everything works fine except when an application tries to initiate an email e.g. when I try to do a simple share a file under Windows Explorer  and click on the email link to send the file nothing happens, Outlook won't open nor wil Windows Mail. After trying to open this email link I can no longer open Outlook until I reboot the system. The exact same thing happens with my Logitech camera software,  when I snap a photo and the application opens the window to allow me to email the photo nothing happens, neither Oulook 2007 nor Windows Mail open and Outlook will no longer open until I reboot.  4) The only other applications I've loaded are Photoshop/Premier Elements 7.0 and Logitech video camera software. Every feature of all applications work fineexcept this email issue.  Do you think the problem lies with the fact that I couldn't complete a MS Works upgrade and just did a fresh install ... is it possible the path is screwed up?Or is it possibly a bug with Vista 64? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers,",

I think it's because I'm having trouble searching for what I need - it's surrounding the \".full\" file extension (so i get a lot of search results that are irrelevant  because of the word \"full\")  Anyway, I found a bunch of old 3.5\" floppy disks from when I was in high school and college in the '90s. I think most of the data on them are some sort of word processing file - I could have sworn I had MS Word on my Mac back then, but maybe not.  I have a USB 3.5\" drive, and with MacDrive software I can browse the disks on Vista. All that works fine. Where the process breaks down is in the file formats.  There are two in particular - one is called \"Floyd.959592A.FULL\" and the Type is \"FULL File\"; the corresponding file is \"Floyd.950502A #001\" and the Type is \"File.\" I'm assuming that these two are the data fork and the resource fork for the one Mac file. (There's  another set, which is \"Floyd.950502B.FULL\" and \"Floyd.950502B #001\")  Does anyone know what these file extensions are from? And how do I convert them into Word? When I try opening in Word 2007 it's still a mishmash of $###*&^%@*@&% type characters, with some smattering of actual English words in there - so I can tell these used  to be word processing docs at some stage.  Are these four files actually some sort of backup? Anyone know how I could proceed?  Thanks.",

I went to rerun the setup process and it only detects the digital tuner in the auto detect mode.I can manually tell it I have an analog tuner and it will set it up just fine but then not bring up the digital tuner.  I know NTSC is going away but I broadcast my second satellite tuner in the family room to all TVs in the house on channel 30. I can't flip between digital channels and the satellite at my PC without rerunning the set up process manually because of this problem.  Any assistance will be much appreciated!",

I have a set of goals that I need to fulfill for this project, however; I am still in the design phase  of the site structure and was thinking of designing the site in a number of ways. However, because I am newer to the SharePoint world, I am on here to inquire about what people have found optimal for designing their site. Before I ask you all, I want to tell  you what I am trying to do:  I want to have a main site for all internal network members, but I want to give different departments their own individual area to communicate. These individual areas should be able to also interact with external tasks and lists (or anything else required by  their work). So basically, I want to have separated areas on the website which are specifically made for departments within the network; but also allow them to cross-interact.   My two current ideas of this so far are: Idea #1: Design the SharePoint Team Site so that there are separate pages for separate departments. Each department page will have their own unique document sharing areas and collaboration  features. Different departments should be able to cross-reference and communicate when needed.  Idea #2: Design the SharePoint Team Site, so that there are separate subsites for separate departments. Each Subsite will only be accessible to the department associated with the subsite;  and only department members of related site may have access. Upon this design, each subsite can communicate with other subsites.  With that all being said, I was wondering if anyone with extensive SharePoint experience has any opinions on those ideas; and what they may find more optimal. Any opinions are highly welcome. I was leaning towards Idea #2, because it gives each department its  own clean area that doesn't mix in with other departments, but the feasibility of it seems questionable.",

The expected behaviour is that the library gets added to my quicklinks list in MySite and that Office picks this up for opening, saving, and, most importantly, enables the end user to create new documents using the content types and document templates of  the document library. It would seem that Office now picks up recently used SharePoint sites using some other mechanism. However, I see no working replacement for creating new documents using SharePoint Content types ie directly from within Word, Files, New menu.  According to this page, there are a number of steps that need to be taken to activate the capability, but it doesn't help when using Office 2016: https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Why-SharePoint-ribbon-buttons-are-unavailable-48b0939a-2efb-4e79-b5e8-b2c4cb5d04ca I have also added my SharePoint Online site to allowed URL:s according to this page: https://thechriskent.com/2012/03/02/fixing-sharepoint-office-integration-problems/ This used to be necessary and helped get clients with Office 2013 working with \"Connect to Office\". Anything I'm missing here or is this feature about to disappear?",

Usual error about not having access/ssldavroot not accessible blah blah blah. Go to IE and use \"open with explorer\" to trigger the authentication.

        "content": "Hello, I have been experiencing some problems with dragging and dropping files from a SharePoint document library to either Outlook or a folder on the client computer. This has been observed on multiple computers with different logins and on two different tenants. The problem in details: When a user use an internet browser to browse to a document library and want to drag a file from the browser to either an Outlook e-mail composing window or a local folder on the pc, a shortcut is created insted of attaching the file tothe e-mail or downloading  it the folder on the PC. Attaching/downloading does work some times, but far from always. I haven't figured a pattern on when it works or when it don't. From another post on the same topic, I have gathered the following informations: Browsers checked with: IE 11, Chrome and Firefox, all updates installed. Operating systems checked with: Windows 7 and 10, all updates installed. Windows 10 also with build 14295. Office packs checked with: Office 2013 and 2016, all updates installed. License used: E3 Filetypes tested with: .docx, .pdf, .pdf PCs tested with: 4 Tenants tested with: 2 Have tried adding the two tenants to the Internet Explorer trusted zone - even tried *.SharePoint.com Have tried clearing the cache of the browsers (IE,Chrome and Firefox) Checked that SharePoint DragDownload Control and SharePoint OpenDocuments Class are enabled. But as I understand it, they  are not needed for this to work in IE 10 and 11? Have tried, while dragging a file to a e-mail composer window, to \"drop\" it on different parts of the window: The body, the narrow space between the body and subject line, on To and CC fields and above the To field. Some times it will work, but only with  dragging the file to the space between the body and subject line. Have tried dragging the file, using the text/title of the file in the document library and also using the icon of the file. When using the icon, some times the mouse pointer icon change into what looks like a copy-icon (the little plus-sign), but when dropping  the file to an e-mail or a folder, does nothing. Please tell me if I should provide you with more info or other tests. Best regards Anders",

        "content": "I am at the end of my rope with OneDrive for Business. Never have I been more confused about a product. I have spent hours reading forum posts and blog posts about the three different versions of OneDrive (which are, for some reason, all called OneDrive).  I am going to give this one last shot before settling for our old way - file sharing with Google Drive. First, here's why I WANT to make this work: - I'd like our organization to be invested in one ecosystem for seamless integration. I love the idea of employees being able to move from workstation to workstation and have access to their own files (via file explorer). - I have this partially working, and can see some really useful features, such as opening Word and seeing my recent files, even if it was on another computer. - The ultimate goal is to have our shared files stored in one central location that all employees have access to, with different permission levels. Previously, with Google Drive, our shared files were owned by individuals and there was no control and the  organizational level. Office 365 was intended to be our solution to this. Here is our environment: - We started with a new install of Office 2016. Understanding that I need the 2013 version of One Drive for Business (groove.exe), I uninstalled 2016, installed 2013. Then reinstalled 2016. I *think* One Drive for Business (groove.exe) is installed  on both computers I am currently working on. If I type \"groove.exe\" into Cortana, One Drive for Business appears, whereas it didn't before the uninstall/reinstall dance. - On my machine - my user account only - I have been able to get it to work beautifully. I logged into the site, used the \"sync\" button, and it synced with my computer locally. So far, the sync works beautifully. In file explorer, under the two One Drive  options, there is a SharePoint access to the team site and files. They are all available through the Office apps, too. It is fantastic.  - Since it is working in one spot, I tried to set it up with a different user account on the same computer. Following the same steps, I try the sync button, it asks me for credentials, then when I click \"next\" nothing happens. Nothing even tries to happen.  It is like I am clicking on a dead button. - I tried to get it going on my user account on a different computer, and the same thing happens. The browser launches groove.exe, OneDrive box appears, it asks me for credentials, and then nothing happens. The same dead next button that goes nowhere. Can you help me make it work? Obviously I got it going once, so I should be able to do it again, right? Apparently not. How do I make it work? I am willing to uninstall everything and start from scratch. Our staff has been without a reliable file structure for days, and I've got to get  this working for them. I have been relying on blog posts and self-service help, which I am usually happy to do, but almost every page I am finding seems to have out of date instructions or references \"OneDrive\" without specifying if it is groove.exe or onedrive.exe or an older  version. I just don't know what to do. Sidenote: I tried to bypass all of this and map a network drive, but the instructions for that didn't work, either.  Another sidenote, if you cannot tell, I am NOT an IT professional. Just a many-hats small business manager who sees a lot of opportunity with this tool and really wants to make it work. Can anyone provideme with step-by-step instructions on how to locally view files located on a Site?  Thanks in advance, Katharine",

I also leave some comments on the side (using the \"New comment\" function), for him to reply my comments.  My questions are: 1. In Word Online (Reading mode), seems the comments on the side will only appear when we click \"Comments\" button on the top right corner. Is there any way to let the \"Comments\" show on the right hand side by default (once we go into the Word Online document)? 2. When my colleague reply to my comments, would there be any way that I can get notified? On Google Doc, we can get email notification via the gmail account. Would there be similar thing for Office 365? 3. Another thing is about the website links. If I add a clickable website link into the Word document, would the target website knows the URL to my Word Online document (they will know if Word Online pass our document link as \"referrer\" to the target website)?  I assume it is no, so the URL of my Word Online document won't be disclosed. Thank you.",

Albeit my company is less involved documents wise, the company I am dealing with has 15,000 items total size of 5GB (Real Estate Management Company). I configured for them last year  a shared network drive, which works great. They can all access the drive and all documents are saved there (to a Mac Pro running Server 2008 in VirtualBox). Now, just migrated over to Office365 for Office integration and Exchange email. What is the best way to sync OneDrive to the network drive? I get a warning saying there are too many files when I go to sync. Does anyone have an easy solution for this? I feel like a limitation like this shouldn't exist. I am familiar with the 5,000 limit  in SharePoint. Really looking to local/remote access here and syncing across OneDrive and the Network share. Thanks for any help!",

However, we are currently trying to figure out the best approach in terms of users interaction with SharePoint Online and how they would go about accessing their files one a day-to-day basis. 1. Do we leave the data on the site and simply provide users with a simple URL so they only have browser access? 2. In addition to the URL do we provide the OneDrive sync client for local access? 3. Do we add the Sharepoint sites directly into office applications? All the above have their pro's and con's. Leaving users to just access information online will certainly alienate many who are accustomed to using file explorer, whereas the one drive sync client throws its own set of challenges; Sync issues , Versioning.  local disk space? Feeding urls into office programs certainly sounds smart in theory however, would this be over complicating it from and end users perspective? Clearly whichever option(s) we take up users will need to adjust to a new way of working, however, we don't want to discourage users and see the need to provide some familiarity. Im looking out people/companies out there who have faced similar challenges and methods they've settled for and why? Thanks for reading and any advise will be hugely appreciated, K.",

This Subsite has approximately 70 items (mainly Pages) indicated in the Navigation. However in the Structural Navigation: Editing and Sorting table, in Navigation Settings, there  are only ~65 items indicated, and as such I am unable to move some of the navigation items under the appropriate headings. It appears that this is a fixed limitation, and that regardless of how many items I have, only ~65 will be displayed in this table.  In Current Navigation, Structured Navigation is set to show pages, and not Subsites.Maximum number of dynamic items in the Current Navigation settings has been increased to 100, so this is not the issue.Structural Navigation: Sorting settings are - sort manually, with pages being sorted automatically by title in ascending order I have read in posts on earlier versions that the fix for this is modifying the web.config file. However I understand that Office 365 does not allow you toaccessthe  web.config file. How do I increase the number of items that the Structured Navigation: Editing and Sorting table displays? Or is this a fixed limitation, and will I need to create a further Subsite to minimise the number of navigation items per site, or utilise another work around?",

I'm wondering if any of this changes for Sharepoint 2016 as it has unique file IDs and hopefully better preservation of metadata during moves/copies....  I note that Windows Explorer copies show metadata preserved after copy, but Sharepoint doesn't access/reflect it.  Observed behavior:  When I sync external nested folders/files (upload) to a Sharepoint library using ONE DRIVE FOR BUSINESS (recommended by MS for LARGE data import)... modified dates for FILES are preserved. modified dates for Folders are not preserved and are set to the date/time imported into Sharepoint.  When I upload / download files using the browser drag/drop copy...   modified dates for files are lost and set to the import date (you can't drag/drop folders via browser)  When I move/copy files and nested folder/files using the OPEN WITH EXPLORER option:  modified dates for files and folders are lost and set to the import date This includes opening an Open With Explorer window for two Sharepoint document libraries and copying between. NOTE that the Explorer window still shows the proper modified dates for both files and folders, even after copying to the new Explorer Window... but Sharepoint can't access or show those dates.  When I copy single files between Document Libraries using the COPY function (in which you must type a carefully crafted URL for the destination library... the built-in sharepoint library select option won't be available till 2016 is enabled)...   modified dates for files and folders are lost and set to the import date  So the overreaching question is will Sharepoint 2016 behave differently and handle preservation of metadata properly? The fact that in even the best situation, folder dates are reset to the copy/move/import date means one always has to open folders  to the file level to see what their dates are. In most cases all dates are lost (even though Windows Explorer still continues to see those dates).  Thanks, Tony",

I have upgraded our previous DIRSync interface to the new Azure AD Connect thinking that would cure the problem but no joy there.  Of the dozen clients, most function properly but there are (2) Windows 10, and (1) Windows 8.1 clients that refuse to open an Excel worksheet using the Excel desktop program unless you supply logon credentials again even though they have already logged  onto Sharepoint. I have followed several threads with the same issue in various other forums. I have followed the recommended changes to the registry, added trusted locations and have not had any success. It also doesn't matter what browser is used either.  It seems to be true that the user's credentials are not being passed along when the file is being opened and would really like to remedy this issue so it can be put to bed and we can move on with other things.",

If you keep seeing this message, contact your IT department. Correlation Id: f8a7889d-408c-3000-a07e-cda0b0324a20 We are using the Office 365 version of Sharepoint.

Some of the background is in these two threads: Add external user with Microsoft Account to UnifiedGroup?; and Office 365 OneNote App access by external user with Microsoft Account?.  I'm satisfied that I can share a Notebook with these external users if I follow these steps:   Share an Office 365 | SharePoint site using Share your site => Invite people and entering an email address. This appears to accept any email address and sends an invitation to it. If the email address doesn't have an associated Microsoft account then the user is prompted to create one. Hopefully, it  would also do something sensible for a Work or school account in another tenant.User accepts the invitation and is granted access to the SharePoint site. After some delay the user is visible to Get-MsolUser and has UserType:Guest; CloudExchangeRecipientDisplayType:6; UserPrincipalName:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.Now that the external guest user is visible in the directory it can be added as a member of the UnifiedGroup and they receive an email informing them of their membership: Subject: Some Body added you to the Some Group group.They can then browse to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/somegroup to find the shared documents, click the three-bar box in the top left corner and select Notebook.They won't be able to find the Notebook in the OneNote App (Microsoft account doesn't know the tenants where it is a guest user?). Is there a simpler way that avoids the need to share an Office 365 | SharePoint site and would allow invitations to be issued directly for the UnifiedGroup?  Is it supposed to work this way? Or am I exploiting an unanticipated feature/bug?  I'm prepared to try to use PowerShell, Microsoft Graph or other technologies if it will make it easier for the external users to get connected.",

I am trying to do this via workflows with calls to the REST API.  For some backgroud here is the full requirement :  Within our organisation we have 12 site collections, one for each team. External sharing has been disabled on all but one site collection. Users within the organisation should be able to raise an external sharing request on their team site. I have done this  with a workflow and a custom action within their document library.  When the workflow is invoked it will capture the name of the external party and their email address using the initiation form parameters on the workflow. On the site collection I've setup for external sharing I have also setup a document library for each team. Inside the teams document library I want to create a folder corresponding to the external party name. This parts works fine by calling the REST API  via a web service and creating a folder.  Next I break permissions on the folder, this work fine too again calling REST API via web services in the workflow.

Right now, I am making a prototype Workflow which will allow members to get assigned to a task, then when that task is done; it will go to a manager for approval. I have been able to model  this intention very accurately; with the only exception being: I can't figure out how to make the Workflow dynamic with end users. I will explain:  The basics of my custom workflow are as follows: Underlined text is where I need help on.  Stage 1 - Workflow Initiation > List item is created, workflow is added to this list item. > List item is assigned to a specific user (Any user chosen by manager.) > End user in receives an email detailing that there is a task assigned to them. > End user responds to workflow and modifies the comments. > List item gets moved to pending status. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > Management rejects the change, and resets the list item into stage 1 OR > Management approves the change, and allows the list item to move to stage 2.  Stage 2 - Workflow Active > Active workflow waits for changes by assigned user. > If approved, the priority is set to low and a list item is made in a external list for logging. List item gets moved to completed status. > If approved, end of workflow. > If rejected, stage 2 resets until manager is satisfied with result.  I want to be able to make it so that a specific user isn't required for the action where you select \"send an email\", since that should be determined by the workflow initiator (The one who created the list and added the user manually in SharePoint).  It seems like when I am designing my workflow however, I need to select a specific user and can't leave it as a variable that will reflect the assigned user. IS there a way to make that happen so the Workflow is dynamic and not specific for a single end-user?  Manually editing the workflow for each user would be tedious and impractical. Everything else is working, I just want my workflow to be less specific to a user and more for anyone who needs to be assigned to a task.  Anyone who really wants to provide input to this feel free to reply in here. I am learning as I go and I have it down pretty good; just some minor nooks and crannies. Also, does anyone know a great site or literature that documents the SharePoint Designer  or making Workflows? I would like some reinforcement on my self-learning via literature.",

I can see the columns in the Crawled Properties, and I can map those to a managed property. When I create the DLP policy off of the managed property it is triggering an alert regardless  of what the properties content. For example I create a custom content type called \"Business File\", and that content type has a column associated with it called \"Business Risk\" which has three levels: Low, Medium, High, with a default of Medium. When I create  a new managed property I can see the crawled property of \"Business Risk\" which I map to a managed property of BRISK. When I create the DLP property, I select custom property of BRISK with a value of \"HIGH\" and block and alert. When I go back to that library  and select New, Business File, it creates the new file, defaults to \"Medium\" on the Business Risk column, which I change to \"Low\". It usually takes about 30 minutes, but then the file will be blocked, regardless of what is in the Business Risk column. If I  upload a file and select as type Business File, it will default to \"Medium\" but DLP will not trigger off of those files, even if I set to \"High\".

It seems to also have problems with other applications like PowerPoint and Project as well.   Log into the SharePoint site and choose to upload multiple files(Note that if you highlight one file and the Shift+Click a second file to select a range of files, the interface doesn't appear to be quickly highlighting the range of files as expected. Note that this process seems to be taking longer than should be expected  before the Open button then works. Note that a security alert icon appears in your Taskbar, in theory, it wanted to ask me if I wanted to allow the browser to access local files but I previously told that dialog to not ask me again.)If you click on that security alert icon in the Taskbar you may see that Word has crashed or is crashing and it's trying to lookup advice from MicrosoftPress the Open button to upload the list to SharePoint and then choose the OK button or similar on that dialog box within the browserWord is now in some unhappy state, in fact there are multiple Word instances which are all unhappy.  Attempting then to close each Word instance you get a system modal dialog which states \"Changes have been made that affect the global template, Normal.dotm. Do you want to save those changes?\" Options include: Save, Don't Save, Cancel and the X in the  upper-right corner. Don't Save produces no response and doesn't dismiss the system modal dialog box as expected. Neither does the Cancel option. And the Save option... still produces no response nor dismisses the system modal dialog box. Only the X dismisses  the dialog box but it doesn't make error state go away.  Attempting then to close the Word instance... displays the system modal dialog box, holding the end-user hostage. It sometimes adds to this a dialog box which indicates \"You cannot close Microsoft Word because a dialog box is open. Click OK, switch to  Word, and then close the dialog box.\" Using Task Manager to attempt to kill the instance produces the same results.  I think I may have finally figured out the right ordering: Task Manager, kill instance, End Task, OK, End Task. This appears to be the method of clearing the error state.  And yet, everytime I upload a collection of files to SharePoint for some reason Office 365 is trying to instantiate separate instances of Word (or PowerPoint or Project or Excel) on a once-per-file basis and in some cases, adjust my Normal.dotm. Why? Guys,  this isn't the way of implementing a cloud-based upload. I'm in the process of uploading a hundred files into SharePoint. The process is really ugly as a result of this deadlock problem that's going on. When you have n instances of Word all trying toupdating the global template they're fighting each other and creating a race condition, presumably. One could ask why you'd want to do so in the first place, what's the benefit?",

Here's my dilemma:  I work in the Box Office at a Performing Arts theatre. We have a large list of people who have subscribed to the next season of shows. Each subscriber has a variety of shows they've subscribed to and different seat locations assigned to them already. Right  now, that data is just in an Excel file. What happens next is that we go into our ticketing system and actually reserve the seats for each subscriber based on what they've been assigned. Currently, we print out the Excel data, which ends up being hundreds  of pages, and work off of that by marking off each order as we go. Printing them out like that opens us up to so many possible problems and errors that I'm sure there has to be a better way. I was thinking of making a Sharepoint site that has all of this  data that multiple people could get to and edit at the same time as they are doing the seating. That way, any changes to be made will be seen by everyone, leaving less room for error. Does anyone have a better idea? I'm not quite sure how to tackle this and would appreciate any help!  Thanks!",

In the folders there are about 175,000 files, with no more than 100 files in each sub folder, some much less only 3 or 4 files.

I cannot got to the library and click checked out files as there are  too many of them. I cannot got to settings>Content and Structure and check them in this way as it will take for ever to go into each subfolder and check in the documents.   Is there another way to CHECK IN the filesin bulk? Where I am not going to run into this threshold limit issue.

Folks find it cumbersome adding multiple calendar items (one to their personal Outlook calendar and the same  thing to the SharePoint calendar)  The end result is folks would like to be able to create one calendar item and have it populate in both calendars.

        "content": "Hi I have encountered the strangest of problems; We have been using various brand computers for years with no issues, including Dell. We recently purchased a batch of Dell Optiplex 7040 computers with Windows 10 Pro. After a day or two, users started reporting that our O365 Sharepoint sites (e.g. tenantname.sharepoint.com) would become inaccessible. The same browser could still access other sites. Other browsers such as Chrome and Firefox had the same issue. A restart of the PC would often fix it but not always. Some users could go a few days without the issue, others would have the issue immediately. There seemed to be no pattern. We also purchased some new model Dell laptops with Windows 10 Pro and they don't have the issue.  I troubleshooted by trying: different network cables different switch ports different brand switches different DNS servers removal of all IE-related GPOs turned off Sophos antivirus used both DHCP and static IP addresses inserted a different NIC wiped the PC and put a fresh build of Win 10 Pro  The problem still persisted with all the above. The common denominators up to this stage were the same OS (Win 10 Pro) and same router (Cisco 2921). Everything else was changed.  Asus laptops, Surface Pros and other Dell laptops all running Windows 10 Pro on the same network don't appear to have the issue. Only the new Dell desktops. Older model Dell desktops running Win 7 Pro are unaffected.  I then put one of the affected new Dell PCs in my home network and with the limited testing I've been able to do, the problem has so far not appeared. The router used here was possibly the main difference for the success.  We trialled another recent model Dell desktop PC with Win 10 Pro. Initially it was going well then the same problem appeared - it would be unable to access our *.sharepoint.com sites. I placed this PC onto a different network which uses a Cisco 877 router  - instantly it started working again. I cable-swapped it back to the corporate network, it worked for a while then stopped again. Back again on the Cisco 877 network and instantly working.  So logic would say that it appears to be 'something' with Dell desktops, their software/drivers and the Cisco 2921 router that is causing the problem. Is there a network packet, TCP stack, socket or protocol related to sharepoint.com that stops functioning  though this type of router?  Everyone is baffled by this so any help is appreciated.  Thanks",

I'm having a little problem with the permission rights though.  I as the owner of the group have full rights on the site. I've grouped all of my students with Read permission which allows them to see the page, but not post a reply. I've taken a look at the permission options and then changed the student group to  have Contribute permission. This solves the issue and allows the students to post replies and comments in the discussion page. But I've very concerned that this has also allowed students to have edit rights on the webpage. Certainly the Edit button now appears  on top of the webpage. Little worried that a student will delete content from the site by accident.   So whats the best thing to do? Can I customise the permission rights at all?  Many Thanks Nick",

If there is no possible way to do this, is there a way to make 3 separate Calendars and put one of top of the other, and force each calendar to have a set  time view?  The way I would envision this is;  { Month 1} *No changes made, uses current month.* { Month 2} *Is locked to display 1 month ahead of Month 1 Calendar.* { Month 3} *Is locked to display 2 months ahead of Month 1 Calendar.*  Is there HTML I could append into a view of one of these months to enforce them to act on those needs, or am I out of luck?",
